# result-component

By this point i finished mobile version and i can say it's been more challenging than i expected at first and made some mistakes but at the same time i can say that i learned a lot of new things.


Whole project is finished, and i'm thrilled, i learned a lot. I know there might be some issues and that i don't have the best semantic or css style, but i'm improving everyday and something more or less funny i learned that IF IT WORKS IT WORKS AND I DON'T DISTURB IT lol

With that being said it's been a pleasure, i wanna give some credits to Kevin Powell (i don't think i have to explain why)
